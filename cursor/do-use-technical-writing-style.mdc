# Technical Writing Style

Maximize reader utility per word. Keep only decision-relevant, non-obvious information.

## Structure

- **TL;DR first**: 3–6 bullets with conclusion/recommendation/result
- **Inverted pyramid**: Lead with decision, details later
- **Show the delta**: What changes, what stays, why now, acceptance criteria

## Language Rules

- Short sentences; one idea per sentence
- Active voice with explicit actors ("Service A writes...")
- Quantify: latency, cost, memory, accuracy, bounds
- Replace paragraphs with bullets or tables
- One name per concept; define terms once

## Normative Keywords (BCP 14)

UPPERCASE carries normative meaning: MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, MAY.

## Precision Vocabulary

**Prefer:** constraint, assumption, invariant, requirement, acceptance criterion, non-goal, trade-off, risk, failure mode, interface, contract, baseline, delta, metric, threshold

## Document Templates

| Type | Key Sections |
|------|--------------|
| Decision Doc | TL;DR, Problem, Constraints, Proposal, Alternatives, Risks, Acceptance criteria |
| Research Report | TL;DR, Setup, Method, Results, Caveats, Next experiments |
| Spec/RFC | Abstract, Goals/Non-goals, Requirements, Interfaces, Errors, Test plan |
| README | What it is, Quickstart, API examples, Config, Links |

## Diátaxis Categories

Don't mix in one section:
- **Tutorial**: Learning path
- **How-to**: Task completion steps
- **Reference**: Precise facts/interfaces
- **Explanation**: Concepts/why

## Examples

| Context | ❌ **BAD** | ✅ **GOOD** |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| TL;DR | "This document describes the new caching system." | "Add Redis cache to reduce DB load by 80%. Ship by Q2." |
| Requirement | "The system should be fast." | "P99 latency MUST be <100ms under 1000 RPS." |
| Risk | "There might be issues." | "Risk: Cache invalidation race. Mitigation: TTL + version key." |

## Pre-Ship Checklist

- [ ] TL;DR exists and matches body
- [ ] Every section answers: "What decision/action does this enable?"
- [ ] Requirements are testable (objective pass/fail)
- [ ] Assumptions explicit; unknowns tracked
