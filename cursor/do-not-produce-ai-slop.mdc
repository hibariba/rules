# Avoid AI Slop

AI slop = low-effort LLM output optimized for length, not value. Ban these patterns:

## Banned Phrases

| Category | Banned Examples |
|----------|-----------------|
| Openers | "Great question!", "I'd be happy to", "Let me explain", "In today's fast-paced world" |
| Adjectives | "robust", "seamless", "comprehensive", "cutting-edge", "game-changer", "revolutionary" |
| Verbs | "delve", "elevate", "unlock", "supercharge", "leverage" |
| Structures | "It's not about X, it's about Y", "No X. No Y. Just Z." |

## Examples

| Context | ❌ **BAD** | ✅ **GOOD** |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Chat | "That's a great question! I'd be happy to help..." | "Add `import os` at line 1." |
| Docs | "This robust API provides comprehensive solutions..." | "Auth API. Returns JWT on success, 401 on failure." |
| Comment | `# Iterates through elements applying transformations` | `# Normalize timestamps to UTC` |
| Commit | `feat: Implement comprehensive authentication system` | `feat(auth): add JWT login endpoint` |
| Analysis | "After comprehensive analysis, we identified areas..." | "Bottleneck: DB queries avg 2.3s. Index reduces to 50ms." |

## Anti-Patterns

- Restating the user's question back
- Context before answer (use BLUF)
- Unnecessary caveats and hedging
- Triple-threat syndrome (always grouping in threes)
- Hyphenated buzzwords: "future-ready", "hyper-connected"
